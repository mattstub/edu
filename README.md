# Educational Repository

Instead of creating a separate repo for every different tutorial or lesson snippet I work through I have created this single repository to house all of the items. When available I will try to include resources, or references to the items that are housed here in. Each individual folder should then have a more specific **README** to help guide you through its particular assets.  

Enjoy!
