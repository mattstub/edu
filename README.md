# Educational Repository

Instead of creating a separate repository for every tutorial or lesson snippet I work through I have created this single repository to house all of my work. When available I will try to include resources, or references to the items that are here. Each individual folder should then have a more specific **README** to help guide you through its particular assets. This was my attempt to retain the work I have done along my journey of learning to code, without muddling up all of my work with useless repositories.   
  
Enjoy!
