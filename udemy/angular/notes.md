# Angular 5

## Components
- Whole application in angular is built by a collection of components
- Makes the program completely modular
- Each component has its own template, business logic, and possibly styling
- Split applications into reusable parts
- Makes the program really easy to update and exchange
- The `AppComponent` is the root component
- Generally speaking each component should have its own folder
- Naming convention would be like `server.component.ts`
- A component is a typescript class
- Add decorators to help Angular identify components
- By default you must declare all of your components, angular does not parse the entire project
