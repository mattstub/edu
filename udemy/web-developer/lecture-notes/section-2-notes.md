# The Front End - Holy Trinity
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## What's the difference between Front End vs Back End?
* The front end is the stuff that you see and interact with
* The back end is everything else, **EVERYTHING** else!
  * Databases, Server Side Language, etc.
* _Restaurant Analogy_ The back end is everything from the kitchen to the table, the front end is what is plated and sent to your table.
  * You order a steak -- send a request (like an HTTP request)
  * The waiter delivers the request to the chef
    * The waiter would act as the browser here
    * The chef or kitchen would be the server
    * The recipe would be the database
    * The ingredients would be the tables within the database
