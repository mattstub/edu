# Modules Export
- Make our code more dry
- Clean up code, keep it short and sweet

1. create a models folder in the root directory of the project
2. make sure to include your 'requires'
3. make separate files for each piece
4. add `module.exports = [the-model]`
5. add a require statement for the file imported `require('./path/sample')`
