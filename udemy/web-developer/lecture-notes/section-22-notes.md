# Introduction to Node
- What is Node?
- Why are we learning it?
- It Doesn't Matter

## Node
- One of the trendiest technologies for the back end right now
- A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JS Engine
  - Uses an event driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient
  - NPM is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world
- Until recently all JS had to be written in the browser
- Node gives JS the ability to be written for back end and free from the browser
- Ability to write JavaScript everywhere, making the language more accessible

## Why are we learning it?
- The smallest reason to learn it is because its trendy
- Popular among existing developers and engineers
- JavaScript has been the most popular language on GitHub since 2012, before it was #2
- Ability to use your front end language in the back end
  - No need to learn a new language to interface both sectors
- Higher performance on the back end than other technologies

## It Doesn't Matter
- Web development changes so often, the technologies are always evolving
- It matters in the short term, its easier to use because you don't need to learn a new language

## Using Node
- REPL in command line
  - Playground for running javascript
  - DOM & ALERT are not applicable here, because its a part of the browser
