Your response goes here!

1.  What new skills have you learned?  
To this point I have been fairly familiar with the HTML aspects that we have learned, having worked with HTML before. However I don't use a lot of the text markup tags very often so had to look up tags for strike through and superscript text.

2.  What has been easy?  
Most of this HTML stuff hasn't changed since I messed with it back in the myspace days outside of some of the wording on text tags, so its been a little bit like hopping back on a bike.

3.  What has been difficult?  
Finding the time to get into all of the curriculum.

4.  How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
Read-Search-Ask is a concept that they try to enforce with the freeCodeCamp lessons, which is much of what was identified in earlier challenges here which has worked well
