    - [x] Also, don't forget to change the image's alt attribute to the name of your animal. 
- [ ] Add the proper CSS to styles.css to recreate the design-prototype.png by applying the style rules in step 4. 
    - [ ] Youâ€™ll need to modify card.html to include attributes and use selectors to specify the elements you want to style. 
    - [ ] Also, make sure to link to your stylesheet in card.html
- [ ] The CSS should apply these styles to match the design prototype:

- [ ] no dots for the animal's list items
- [ ] border around the animal's name, image, and information
