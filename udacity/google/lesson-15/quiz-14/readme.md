# Colors of the Rainbow

### Directions:
James was creating an array with the colors of the rainbow, and he forgot some colors. The standard rainbow colors are usually listed in this order:  
`var rainbow = ["Red", "Orange", "Yellow", "Green", "Blue", "Purple"];`  
but James had this:  
`var rainbow = ["Red", "Orange", "Blackberry", "Blue"];`  
  
Using only the splice() method, insert the missing colors into the array, and remove the color "Blackberry" by following these steps:  
- Remove "Blackberry"
- Add "Yellow" and "Green"
- Add "Purple"
