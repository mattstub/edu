# freeCodeCamp Project - Local Weather App
This is my freeCodeCamp project for a Local Weather App. I created the app utilzing the freeCodeCamp Weather API so that I would not need to expose any API Key's in the process. To add a bit of flair I utilized the Weather Icon's provide by ErikFlowers, which can be found in the link below, however it is no longer maintained.
