# JavaScript30
[JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) is a 30 Day Vanilla JavaScript tutorial by Wes Bos.  
[Starter Files](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30) can be found here.  

This repository will hold each of the 30 challenges as I complete them, as well as a short journal entry for my thoughts on each of the exercises. I have incorporated the necessary starter files and sounds that Wes utilizes throughout the program.
