This tutorial introduced me to some new transition functions. Not having much of a love for CSS and Styling, I often overlook a lot of what CSS can do to help my projects. So learning the *transition-timing-function* was very informative. And playing with its values inside dev tools is very intuitive. Being able to play with the values for the *cubic-bezier* attribute was great.  
  
Another item I often overlook is how to manipulate css styles with JavaScript, again I tend to default to introducing classes and then toggling these classes back and forth with jQuery, but this often would leave me grasping for air and spending way too much time thinking about how to make styling work. This was very evident when transforming the style of the different hands every function call.  
  
One thing I tend to overthink as well is in variable terms, if I had written this program from the ground up, initially I would think that all of the function variables needed to be flexible and would have instantiated them with **let** instead of **const** not remembering that these variables only need to remain constant for the period they are called and that the function is called every second with new values.  
  
All in all, this was a very simple, quick but effective tutorial!
