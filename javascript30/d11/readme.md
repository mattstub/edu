Who knew making a custom video player could be done in about 300 lines of code? The JS for this was incredibly straight forward. I love how Wes utilizes data values within the HTML and then works them in the script functions. Another great experience from participating in these lessons has been to really understand more of the event listener functionality. Up until now i've taken it to be so literal, i've been losing out on so much more potential.  
  
Originally I thought event listeneres were really for the purpose of just handling user events happening, but chaining them on other events that are firing on the page really opens up my mind to understand how more things take place with less workarounds!
