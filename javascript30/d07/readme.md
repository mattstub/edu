Having worked with *find* and *findIndex* before through my *freeCodeCamp* lessons these were pretty easy to grasp. Using them with ES6 and the implicit return makes them so much more clean than before however.  
  
I was not aware of the *some* and *every* methods, which are also very helpful in some use cases where I may have tried to work *filter* or *find* before in some workaround use case. I can see more possible use cases for *some* method than I can for the *every* method at this point, but I'm sure just like my limited knowledge on using spread operators that will change as we go.  
  
And once again Wes illustrates more opportunities to use the spread operator. What I'm beginning to think is I have been thinking about this all wrong the whole time, ha!
