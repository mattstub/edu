Working with persistance in the browser was great, I've never played with this so great to see things at work. Knowing that some thins exist and how to get ahold of them seems to be half the battle almost all of the time. I didn't know there was a *localStorage* that could be accessed with *setItem, getItem, or remove*. And while this may not be used all of the time, it's handy to know there's a place to cache things as needed.

Again with Wes and his great analogies on handling event delegation, this really helped me out because when I tried to complete a lot of my **freeCodeCamp** challenges I was battling this type of problem with events, so I would take the easy way out and use *jQuery* when needed instead of truly understanding how to handle the event.
