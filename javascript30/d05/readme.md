Haven't ever played much with flexbox or much with different transition styling before, so these small little tweaks are great going forward! Can make things look so much more fluid with just small tweaks here and there!  
  
In this lesson, there really wasn't much new on the JS side that I learned, outside of maybe how the *transitionend* event listener fires, but the CSS flexbox stuff was fantastic!
