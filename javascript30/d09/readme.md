I found this to be a really helpful tutorial, since I don't honestly mess with dev tools too much being a part time hobbyist that doesn't stray away from known things that often. Some of these could be quite helpful, especially the *warn*, *error*, *info* tags to start. I like the *assert* tag but if you are going to that much trouble I feel like you might as well just be using a proper test suite. However I can see where it would be helpful in setting up some tests.  
  
The *group* and *groupCollapsed* would have been very helpful to have been familiar with while working through my **freeCodeCamp** curriculum since I sent so much of that work to the console to understand and a lot of times I would get some lengthy groups going on.
