Coming from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) I am really accustomed to jumping towards jQuery for most of what I do in JavaScript. So learning how these same functions are performed with Vanilla finally helped me to connect the dots on some things that just seemed like pure magic to me. I also found Wes's explanation on how *this* works behind the scenes to be very helpful. All in all I followed along with his code instead of doing this myself but it was still very informative to watch him code through this in Vanilla.
