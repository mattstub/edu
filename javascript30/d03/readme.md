To utilize CSS variables without a preprocessor like Sass, you have to declare them on the object, in this instance we applied them to the root object to keep it generic. This allows us to change them in one central location, much like you would with a preprocessor. Very informative bit of CSS I was not aware of before this!  
  
**querySelectorAll** has the **forEach** prototype function available so that it's not always necessary to convert the node list to an array for simple manipulations.  

Another thing to remember with variables in css is to always account for the suffix of an attribute (px, rem, em, etc..). This can be used with data-key's in the html!  
  
This was one of the shorter lessons so far (I know, only 3 in), but this was incredibly informative! Always love improving some styling skills!
