I always find lessons on built in functions for arrays to be incredibly helpful. Since the only coding background I have other than JavaScript is C++ from back in High School, I have the tendency to think that I have to build a for loop for everything, when in fact most of what I need is already given to use in the form of a method.  
  
Finally finding a use case for the spread operator was great! I learned what it was a couple months back but have never had any reason to utilize it, so converting over a node list to an array became very quick work with the spread operator!  
  
And as always practicing ternary operators is great stuff! Keeping things as condensed and clean as possible makes me happy.
